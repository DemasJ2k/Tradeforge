Strategy 1: VWAP + MACD Breakout Scalping
Timeframe: 1-minute (also applicable on 5-minute).
Indicators: VWAP, MACD (and optionally ATR for SL).
Long Entry Conditions:
Price closes above the VWAP line (indicating bullish bias) and the MACD line crosses above its
signal line (bullish momentum) . For example, wait for a close above VWAP with MACD line >
signal line.
(Alternate/confirming filter: VWAP as support.) If price bounces up off VWAP (using it as intraday
support) while MACD turns bullish, this also signals a long entry .
Short Entry Conditions:
Price closes below the VWAP line (bearish bias) and the MACD line crosses below its signal line
(bearish momentum) . For example, a close under VWAP with MACD line < signal line.
(Alternate: Price testing VWAP from above and failing as resistance, confirmed by a bearish MACD
cross .)*
Exit Rules:
Momentum exit: Exit when the MACD line crosses back (i.e. signal line crosses MACD line) in the
opposite direction . This locks in gains when momentum wanes.
Price target exit: As an alternative exit, take profit at the next key intraday level (e.g. Pivot R1 for
longs or Pivot S1 for shorts, or strong S/R) . VWAP itself is also a rotating mean – one could
exit when price reaches VWAP again.
Stop-Loss / Take-Profit:
Stop-Loss: Place SL just beyond a recent swing high (for shorts) or low (for longs) . Alternatively,
use ATR: e.g. SL = entry ± (1–2×ATR) to allow for typical volatility. Using ATR for SL is common in multiindicator systems .
Take-Profit: Can be fixed/volatile. Options include: (a) close at an opposite MACD cross, (b) take
partial profit at VWAP or daily pivot levels, or (c) set a small fixed target (e.g. 10–15 pips on XAUUSD)
. In a fast scalp, many traders use a small pip target (like +$1.0–$1.5 per trade) and quick exit.
Notes: VWAP tracks the volume-weighted average price and helps define intraday trend . This
strategy essentially trades momentum breakouts: above/below VWAP confirmed by MACD. It works
best in relatively trending moves. ATR can also be used as a trailing stop to manage risk and lock
profits 



Strategy 2: RSI + Bollinger Band Reversal Scalping
Timeframe: 1-minute (reversal style).
Indicators: RSI, Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2σ), ATR (for SL), ADX (for trend filter).
Long Entry Conditions:
Price is at or below the lower Bollinger Band (suggesting a short-term oversold spike), and the RSI
crosses above the oversold threshold (e.g. rises above 20 or 30) . This indicates a short-term
bottom and momentum shift.
(Example: RSI rising from below 20 while price touches the lower BB signals a bounce .)*
Optionally require ADX < 20 to ensure a non-trending (ranging) environment, as Bollinger reversals
work better when markets are not strongly trending .
Short Entry Conditions:
Price is at or above the upper Bollinger Band (an overextended high), and the RSI crosses below
the overbought threshold (e.g. falls below 80 or 70) .
(Example: RSI falling from above 80 while price touches upper BB signals a top .)*
Exit Rules:
Exit when price reaches the opposite Bollinger Band (e.g. bounce from lower to middle/upper band
for longs) . This captures the reversal move.
Alternatively exit when RSI reaches the opposing extreme or neutral zone (e.g. RSI crosses 50 or
enters opposite OB/OS region) . For instance, if long, exit when RSI climbs above 50 or 70.
Stop-Loss / Take-Profit:
Stop-Loss: Place SL just outside the Bollinger band or beyond the recent swing that invalidates the
reversal . For example, a long trade might have SL below the lower band or previous low. ATR can
also set SL (e.g. 1×ATR below entry).
Take-Profit: Profit can be taken at the opposite band or at a small pip gain. E.g. close longs when
price nears the middle/upper band or RSI enters overbought. Some traders use a small fixed TP (10–
15 pips on gold) for quick exits . A trailing stop (e.g. 1×ATR) can also lock gains.
Notes: This is a classic reversal scalping setup. Bollinger Bands flag extreme volatility and price
points; RSI confirms momentum exit of OB/OS zones . For range-like conditions (ADX <20) this
provides high-probability bounces. In trending markets, this may give false signals, so consider
filtering by ADX (avoiding trades when ADX >25)





Strategy 3: 200-EMA + VWAP “Trick Move” Scalping
Timeframe: Multi-chart – use 15-minute for trend filter, 1-minute for entry.
Indicators: 200-period EMA (on 15m or higher), VWAP (on 1m), (optional) RSI/ATR.
Long/Short Entry Conditions:
Trend Filter: First check the 15m chart. If price is above the 15m 200-EMA, bias long; if below, bias
short . Ignore trades against this bias. (This emulates a daily trend filter.)
“Trick Move” Setup: On the 1m chart, watch for a false breakout (“trick”) of a recent high (for longs)
or low (for shorts):
For a LONG: The 1m price briefly spikes above a recent high and above the VWAP, then
quickly falls back below VWAP with a bearish wick candle . This shows upward
pressure failed, offering a buy-the-dip opportunity. Enter long when a bearish candle closes
below VWAP after the spike.

For a SHORT: Symmetrically, price dips below a recent low and below VWAP, then returns
above VWAP with a bullish wick. Enter short when a bullish candle closes above VWAP (failing
to continue down).
Exit Rules:
Because this is a small mean-reversion trade, take profit quickly. A common rule is a fixed small
target (e.g. 10–15 pips on XAUUSD) . Alternatively, exit when price nears the 15m 200-EMA or
daily pivot after retracing the move.
Stop-Loss / Take-Profit:
Stop-Loss: Place SL just beyond the extreme of the “trick move” spike. For a long entry, SL is just
below the spike high; for a short, just above the spike low . This caps loss if the breakout
continues.
Take-Profit: Typically a small fixed TP (10–15 pips) or when momentum visibly reverses. In [15], the
trader closes positions with ~+10–15 pips . You can also trail with ATR (e.g. 1×ATR) to catch a bit
more if momentum stays.
Notes: This strategy exemplifies using multi-timeframe analysis. The 200-EMA (or 200-SMA) on 15m
defines trend direction . The VWAP on 1m identifies intraday fair value. The “trick move” (price
rejects a breakout and returns through VWAP) signals exhaustion . It’s essentially a countertrend scalp against a false breakout. SL/TP are tight since XAUUSD moves fast – small pip targets are
normal for scalpers




Strategy 4: Pivot Point Breakout/Reversal Scalping
Timeframe: 5-minute (can also apply on 15m). Use daily pivot points (central pivot, R1/R2, S1/S2).
Indicators: Daily Pivot Points, (optional) ADX, Stochastic, ATR.
Long Entry Conditions: Two variants:
Pivot Breakout (Trending): If price closes above the central pivot of the day, this indicates bullish
momentum . After a candle closes above pivot, enter long on the next candle if it opens above
and continues up. Consider confirming that ADX is high (e.g. >20) to ensure a trend .
Pivot Bounce (Ranging): If price pulls back to a support pivot level (central pivot or S1) and shows a
bullish reversal (e.g. bullish engulfing candle) while an oscillator is oversold (Stochastic <K crosses up
from <20), enter long. This assumes price will respect pivot support. Optionally require ADX <20 to
favor a range bounce.
Short Entry Conditions: Mirror above:
Pivot Breakout: Price closes below the central pivot, signaling bearish bias . Enter short on a
follow-through candle that opens below pivot. ADX >20 is preferred.
Pivot Bounce: Price rallies up to resistance pivot (central pivot or R1) and reverses (e.g. bearish
candle or Stochastic >80 crossing down). Enter short on that bounce. ADX <20 suits this range move.
Exit Rules:
For Breakout trades: Take profit at the first pivot target: For longs target R1, for shorts target S1
. (Price often stalls at the first S/R after a breakout.) You may then trail stops or take further
partial profits at R2/S2.
For Bounce trades: Exit near the pivot point line or at mid-range. For example, if long from pivot
support, exit when price retraces back to the pivot or halfway up to R1.
Stop-Loss / Take-Profit:
Stop-Loss: For breakouts, SL can be set just inside the pivot level (e.g. just below pivot after a bullish
breakout) or use ATR distance. For bounce trades, SL goes beyond the level that was tested (e.g.
below S1 for a bounce long, above R1 for a bounce short).

Take-Profit: As above, R1/S1 for breakouts. For bounce trades, fixed small pips or ATR multiples (e.g.
target 1–2×ATR from entry) work. Pivot strategy often uses partial exits at each S/R (e.g. half at R1,
half at R2 ).
Notes: Pivot points provide fixed S/R levels derived from prior session’s range . A key rule:
trading above the pivot is bullish, below is bearish . ADX can guide strategy choice: if ADX is high
(>25), favor the breakout method; if ADX is low, favor bounces (the market is range-bound). VWAP
can also serve as a dynamic “pivot” pivot for the day if needed. ATR helps set appropriate SL/TP,
capturing gold’s volatility.
Each strategy above uses only the specified TradeForge indicators and can be implemented by setting
indicator conditions. They blend trend/momentum filters with volatility or level indicators to scalp XAUUSD
effectively. (All indicator values – e.g. RSI periods, band widths, ATR multipliers – should be tuned to your
charts as needed.)
Sources: The strategies above adapt common scalping patterns. For example, combining VWAP with MACD
is a known momentum approach . RSI/Bollinger reversals are widely cited for 1m trades .
Pivot breakout techniques are standard (price closes beyond daily pivot, target R1/S1) . A beginner gold
scalper specifically recommends using a higher-timeframe EMA trend filter plus a 1m VWAP reversal “trick”
setup . Stops and targets often use ATR or small pip gains . All these ideas are drawn from
trading guides and strategy analyses
